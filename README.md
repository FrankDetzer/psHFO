## SYNOPSIS
psHFO is my heavily inspired PowerShell module of "ncdu" (NCurses Disk Usage made by Yoran Heling). I was able to get in touch with him and he is fine with my project. My intend with this module is provide an easy and open-source console-based disk usage analyzer for PowerShell mainly used on windows.
